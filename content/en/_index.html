        <p> The ten partners involved in the multi-year cultural cooperation project <strong>PROSPERO - Extended Theatre</strong> seek to make an artistic, cultural, and political statement through an ambitious theatrical initiative that contributes to the shaping of a shared artistic and cultural Europe. Among their goals: to broaden the dissemination of theatrical works, both in venues and across digital spaces, in order to reach new audiences. This platform is designed to support that ambition.  </p>
