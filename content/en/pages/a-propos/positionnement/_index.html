    <p>Why design a self-training platform for data management in the live show?  <br>   <br>This platform is aimed at all members of cultural institutions working closely or far on issues of public development and retention. It is therefore aimed simultaneously at administrative and legal departments and services, ticketing services and communications teams, as well as those responsible for relations with the public. The partners of the European project Prospero Extended Theatre, the originator of this publication, wanted to propose, as part of their European project, a tool to help those responsible for defining and implementing public strategies. With this resource, they will be able to master the range of issues, applications, and possibilities induced by the exploitation of data in the context of live entertainment. The concept of  data literacy  is defined as "the ability to access, interpret, evaluate, manage, manipulate and use data critically and ethically (Calzada-Prado and Marzal, 2013) through knowledge of the characteristics of the data, its life cycle and the various impacts of its use, including security and privacy" (Verdi, 2023). </p>  <p>  Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion <br>Edwards Deming <br>Statisticien</p>  <p>   <br>"If the term data or data has long been part of the vocabulary of the performing arts professionals, it is uneven and often with a great deal of incomprehension about its issues," recalled Anne Le Gall, co-founder and general delegate of TMNlab at TMNlab 2022 meetings. Training is needed to develop responsible uses, in accordance with the law, that effectively serve the institution's cultural project. That's why we're offering this digital space, which we hope will enable it to become competent according to its own needs, its initial mastery of the stakes - and its curiosity. </p>  <p> Training in Data literacy is political, and economic  <br>   <br>According to Ugo Verdi (2023), this data acculturation must enable the formation of "data readerates" (data readerates), people "understanding, explaining and documenting the usefulness and limitations of data by becoming a consumer of critical data, capable of managing its digital traces, finding meaning in the data and making decisions based on it". If the  Data Literate  is not considered a technical expert, but understands the issues of data and has some expertise in their manipulation.  In the cultural sector, the attitude of professionals towards data seems to have changed significantly recently. According to Julie Knibbe (2023) "They first showed some mistrust of these new methods of work, and they understand more and more the value they can derive from using the data to assist them. There is a decline in the number of debates between intuitive approaches (where artistic quality prevails) and data-driven approaches (data-driven) as maturity develops. The author also highlights the challenges facing the living spectacle, "related to the ownership and sharing of data between actors, and to the technical, political and regulatory issues associated with it, such as the protection of personal data", which only reinforce the urgent need for the sector to become more competent.</p>  <p> In view of the near-total digitization of our world, it is more than time for professionals to embrace these topics. When, in 2000, a quarter of the world's recorded information was in digital format, 98% of the world's recorded information was in digital format in 2013. These digital spaces have become areas of socialization for a large majority of citizens, and this far beyond the borders that the media now struggle to cross in certain segments of the population (see the fact sheet "The increasingly digitized cultural practices?"). For cultural public service projects whose aim is to reach the widest possible audience, not investing these spaces would be to fail in its mission. In addition, these data represent an important lever for cultural marketing. As stated by the Diagnostic Competencies and Future Trades UNOCO LAB produced by TMNlab and Hacnum, "The explosion in the volume of data produced, coupled with the improvement of technologies in the collection and mass processing of data, is an opportunity for cultural structures to make data a strategic lever in the acquisition, retention and possible monetization of their audiences".</p>  <p>  No project goes forward without a content-based communication strategy tailored to digital issues and social networks <br>Claire Andries <br>Direction and support for cultural and artistic projects</p>  <p>   <br>The other objective of this platform is to enable cultural operators to train independently, and to develop an emancipated competence for the intervention of their suppliers or software publishers. When these data are collected, professionals in the sector face a lot of difficulties in accessing and interpreting them (Knibbe, 2023), which is why cultural professionals need to develop their own data management skills without depending on their surroundings from service providers and ticketing, CRM or marketing providers. This time spent fighting against what Bernard Stiegler called "generalised proletarization", i.e. the destruction of knowledge in all its forms, especially the know-how of workers, which he links with the anarchical and savage (i.e. ultra-liberal) development of the digitisation of trades and the massive automation of processes. (Stiegler, 2015, P31-32). With a better understanding of the issues involved, the teams will be able to balance the balance of power with providers who have technical knowledge of these issues, but who do not always share the same vision of their use. This will enable them to collaborate more equally with their partners.</p>  <p> Ethical and ecological perspective on cultural marketing and data management  <br>   <br>Interesting in cultural marketing and its digital tools, it is also confronted with wide ethical and ecological issues. Indeed, the technologies and services that make up the tools of marketing teams can create reservations, see dilemmas, as their principles and effects on society are sometimes opposed to the principles and values defended by living entertainment. </p>  <p> A state of play and a stake in positioning  <br>This affects, for example, Ad-exchange, a virtual stock exchange where advertisers looking for digital advertising space buy space on sites that meet their audience needs, at a variable price dictated by the logic of supply and demand (see the fact sheet dedicated to online advertising techniques). This is also the case for the many artificial generative intelligences that have not left the public debate since they entered the market, and are the subject of extensive research on their social and environmental impacts (see the dedicated fact sheet). Finally, this is the case with the heated debate that takes place during the writing of these lines and this time concerns social networks. Indeed, the abandonment of the moderation policies announced by Meta (Facebook and Instagram) and the X network has pushed many media, cultural and academic actors to leave these platforms. This debate affects up to the content creators, yet dependent on these social spaces, as well as the world of institutional communication. These platforms, while allowing the expression of popular uprisings like the Arab Springs, have also contributed to harmful and profound social phenomena.  With regard to cultural facilities, the choices are cornelian: is it possible to fulfil its role of democratization by leaving these social platforms? Would it not be better to learn how to master the codes in order to continue to feed a social space where the cultural practices of so many individuals are formed? Should we deprive ourselves of the possibility of touching or retaining a wider audience thanks to the possibilities offered by the Ad-exchange? Or to free up valuable time to its teams by mastering the technologies of generative AI? <br>Some sources to feed your thinking:   <br>  <br> Half a liter water for 25 questions: hidden costs of using GPT Chat Hugo Payen, RTBF, September 25, 2024.   <br>  <br>  <br> Microsoft study reveals that the more people use AI in their work, the less critical they are. , Mathis Lucas, Intelligence-artificial.develop.com, February 11, 2025   <br>  <br>  <br> Post Instagram account Prepare for fight  of 15 January 2025  <br>  <br> Brands & companies : Should we still be active and stay on Meta's social networks? , The communicator's blog, 12 January 2025  <br> #StopHateForProfit – Time to talk about Facebook ., Nü Agency, 30 June 2020 </p>  <p> An approach through knowledge and attention  <br>The approach we defend in this platform is that carried by the TMNlab. This community of professionals, whose salaried team has written this project, defends daily a digital "located" and encapsulating approach to digital, societal and technological transformation. Without ever going into technocentrism, here we put the tools <br>cultural projects, taking full advantage of the <br>counts the reality of the actors who carry them, and of the public. That is why we will not advocate the use or abandonment of a particular tool, but aim to deliver you the keys to make informed choices. We approach technical knowledge from the meaning given to its mastery: it is a question of making possible responsible use of the data, in the most autonomous way possible, in the service of the cultural project. We also propose a form of data-sobriety consisting of mobilising data as close as possible to real needs, to evaluate, objectiveize perceptions and choices, disentangle, disassemble our biases. And this for the same always renewed purpose: reaching the widest possible audience, and ensuring the discovery of your cultural projects. While taking care of your teams through the correct formulation of objectives and better allocation of resources. Our approach is certain: To make informed decisions about these tools, to draw a sober and responsible use, it is necessary to train! Without ever going into technocentrism, here we put the tools and techniques at the service of cultural projects, taking fully into account the reality of the actors who carry them, and the audiences who benefit from them. Through this platform, we hope to enable you to understand these multiple challenges and give you the keys to making your choices, in full consciousness and independence.</p>

Without ever going into technocentrism, here we put the tools and techniques at the service of cultural projects, taking fully into account the reality of the actors who carry them, and the audiences who benefit from them.</p><p>Through this platform, we hope to enable you to understand these multiple challenges and give you the keys to making your choices, in full consciousness and independence.</p>
