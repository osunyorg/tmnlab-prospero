    <p>  <br>In a world where digital transformation redefines cultural practices and economic models of live entertainment, it is essential for industry professionals to develop new skills to understand, exploit and benefit from digital tools and data. TMNlab, founded by peers as a laboratory for experimentation and reflection on the changes of the show living in the digital age, accompanies this transition by bringing together a community of professionals and providing strategic resources to strengthen their data literacy, their cultural marketing skills and their mastery of digital issues.</p>  <p> A community at the service of skills development  <br>   <br>TMNlab brings together a wide network of actors in the live show – ticket managers, communications officers, cultural mediators, producers, artists, developers of digital solutions and researchers – around a collaborative and open dynamic. Far from being limited to a purely technological approach, the community focuses on the critical and strategic understanding of digital usages, thus promoting an informed appropriation of tools and methodologies adapted to the realities of the sector.</p>  <p> Data Literacy and Cultural Marketing: Better Understanding and Exploitation of Data  <br>   <br>In a context where data management and analysis become a major lever of development, TMNlab supports entertainment professionals living in the appropriation of audience data management methods and tools. The cultural facilities now have numerous digital contact points (online banknotes, CRM, social networks, streaming platforms, public surveys...) that generate a wealth of data. But how can they be structured, interpreted and exploited to better understand its audiences and adjust its strategies? TMNlab proposes:  <br> Practical resources, the day before and studies.  <br> Webinars and trainings dedicated to the digital transformation of live entertainment, integrating modules on digital marketing, data analysis and CRM tool management.  <br>  <br> A space for peer exchange, where professionals share their experiences, test solutions and co-build new approaches adapted to the specifics of the sector. </p>  <p> A resource centre rooted in the digital transformation of live entertainment  <br>   <br>Beyond data literacy and marketing, TMNlab supports cultural structures in a strategic reflection on their digital transformation. The issue is not just to adopt new tools, but to adapt organizations, practices and professions to technological changes and changes in public practice. Examples of topics addressed:  <br> How can we rethink cultural mediation models in the digital age?  <br>  <br> What tools and methodologies to build an effective and responsible communication strategy?  <br>  <br> What are the impacts of digital technology on the production and distribution of works?  <br>  <br> How can artificial intelligence solutions be integrated into management and artistic creation processes? </p>  <p> Selected resources </p>  <p>Cultural data</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/donnees-culturelles/</p>  <p>Recovery</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/decouvrabilite/</p>  <p>Billetterie / CRM / date</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/billetterie-crm-data/</p>  <p>Marketing digital</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/e-marketing-sea/</p>  <p>Content strategy</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/blogs-et-revues-en-ligne/</p>  <p>Social media management / Influence</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/cm-reseaux-sociaux/</p>  <p>Organizational transformation</p>  <p>https://www.tmnlab.com/tag/transformation-numerique/</p>
