    <p>  <br>The Pavilion Theatre, located in Ireland, has embarked on a strategic digital shift to optimize its relationship with its audience and improve its ROI. In the face of changing usages and increasing online sales, the theatre marketing team has gradually abandoned print media to a social media approach and data analysis. The use of Facebook Ads, coupled with the integration of Google Analytics and Ticketsolve, allowed a fine measure of the performance of advertising campaigns. The installation of the Facebook conversion pixel and the exploitation of remarketing data have led to impressive results: an average ROI of 680% on Facebook campaigns, with a peak of 4000 % for some of them. Far from being limited to a purely transactional logic, the theatre has adopted a strategy of storytelling on social networks, favouring the promotion of engaging content such as behind-the-scenes performances or immersive videos, rather than direct calls to purchase. Finally, the Pavilion Theatre attributes its success to its ability to adapt and its openness to change. Visual consistency on social networks, experimentation with new formats such as video, as well as an approach based on continuous analysis of performance, are proving to be key levers to strengthen public engagement and maximise the impact of digital campaigns.
