    2.02 And what about me — do I have data?
  summary: >-
    <p>So, a little suspense? The answer is... yes! With this card, we help you identify and understand them.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>This very short sheet is designed to guide you in your reading. To begin answering this question, we first invite you to read the sheet But actually, what is data? - and in particular the section What are the different types of data in the context of the performing arts? Next, go to the sheet Mapping and organising my data, which explains how to: identify the types of data to be mapped, create an inventory of data sources, and analyse the quality and structure of your data. And because when we talk about data, we think not only of quantitative aspects but also of qualitative ones, we also encourage you to explore the sheet Producing data with stakeholders. You can also browse all the sheets in Section 2, where you'll find more detailed information based on different tools (ticketing software, website, CRM, social media, etc.). Happy reading!  </p>
