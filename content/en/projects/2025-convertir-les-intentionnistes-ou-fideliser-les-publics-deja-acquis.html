    4.02. Converting "intentionists" or retaining already acquired audiences?
  summary: >-
    <p>In this sheet, one understands why it is impossible to address all types of audiences at the same time, and why it is necessary to sequence its marketing actions in order to be effective.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>As explained in a dedicated fact sheet (Hyperlink to 33; How to formulate strategic objectives and goals?), defining clear objectives and strategic goals is a crucial step for deploying an effective audience management strategy. This is especially true in live performing arts, where communication and marketing resources are often limited. Optimizing each action increases its impact on the audience... and saves resources. A common mistake is trying to address all audiences simultaneously, hoping everyone will find something relevant. However, not all spectators share the same level of engagement with your institution nor the same expectations. By leveraging audience data analysis (ticketing, CRM, digital interactions), it is possible to identify several profiles and design tailored strategies for each. This segmentation can be based on many audience characteristics - a dedicated fact sheet covers this topic (Link to 26 Define audiences to adapt your address). Here, we focus on the very principle of segmentation and explain its stakes.  </p>  <p> The urgent need to segment marketing actions for them to be effective  <br>  </p>  <p>Data analysis enables the identification of several audience typologies, each requiring a specific approach:</p>  <p> Different audience typologies </p>  <p>   <br>Expectations and action levers differ from one segment to another.  A communication that is too broad risks being ineffective, as it will not address the specific needs of each group. Therefore, it is not about choosing broadly between loyalty or audience diversification, but rather about sequencing your action plan and tailoring your messaging according to the stage of relationship with these audiences.</p>  <p> Adapting strategies based on the level of engagement  <br> Converting intentionists: from interest to purchase  <br>The intentionists are those who have shown interest but have not yet made a purchase. It is essential to understand their barriers and offer them tailored incentives, such as: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Personalized reminders:  emails or notifications following cart abandonment or after viewing multiple shows on the site. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Discovery offers:  preferential rates for a first purchase, tickets at 50% off for the first show. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Social proof and storytelling:  highlighting audience reviews, artist interviews to create an emotional connection. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Emphasizing ease of access:  content explaining the evening's flow, venue access, dress code to remove potential psychological barriers.  <br> </p>  <p> Encouraging repeat visits from occasional attendees  <br>  Spectators who have attended only once are at a crucial moment: they either return or disappear from your radar. The goal is to stimulate their curiosity and show them that coming back is worthwhile. Some examples: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Post-event follow-up:  a thank-you email with personalized recommendations based on the show they attended. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>"Bring a friend" offer:  a discount or invitation to come accompanied. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Highlighting a tailored program:  suggestions of similar shows based on their initial preferences. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Communication on the benefits of returning:  advantages for regular attendees (VIP offers, meetings with artists, etc.).  <br> </p>  <p> Loyalty-building for spectators on the path to becoming regulars  <br>  These spectators are on the verge of becoming loyal but have not yet adopted regular attendance habits. It is essential to build their loyalty through various levers: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Loyalty program:  reward points, invitations to exclusive events, early access to ticket sales. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Promotion of flexible subscriptions:  tailored plans encouraging gradual commitment. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Relational communication:  non-commercial emails to strengthen the connection (artist interviews, behind-the-scenes content, making-of). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Targeted offers:  privileges for spectators who return two or more times during the season.  <br> </p>  <p> Engaging loyal spectators further and turning them into ambassadors  <br>Loyal spectators form the solid foundation of an institution's audience. They should not be overlooked in favor of new audiences. Their engagement is a powerful lever for action: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br> Recognition and appreciation:  personalized thank-yous, highlighting the most loyal spectators to encourage others, VIP events. <br>  <br>  <br> Community engagement:  dedicated groups, discussion forums, meetings with artists. <br>  <br>  <br> Co-creation:  opportunities to influence programming, access to rehearsals. <br>  <br>  <br> Exclusive benefits:  invitations to previews, preferential pricing, early access to ticket sales, referral offers to encourage word-of-mouth. </p>  <p> Re-engaging dormant spectators  <br>A dormant spectator is someone who has previously visited a venue but whose last visit was several months or years ago. They may not be lost yet: although disengaged, they still have a history with the institution. Here are some examples to reawaken them: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Personalized emailing:  reminders of recent shows attended, emotional or nostalgic communication, highlighting new offerings (services, promotions, positioning). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Surveys and involvement:  understanding reasons for disengagement, raising awareness about measures taken to address them. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Targeted ads and offers:  retargeting campaigns, exclusive email offers, SMS invitations.  <br> </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>We decided to reactivate the profiles of our "dormant" spectators-those who had not attended our events for at least three years. Then, we sent them an email campaign to check in and remind them of the unique cultural experiences we offer. The response was very encouraging. A large majority of those contacted were moved by our message and expressed their desire to return to our venues. Attendance at the theatre has since increased.</p>  <p>Lina Licciardi,  <br>responsable de l'accueil et de la billetterie du Théâtre de Liège</p>  <p> Building a Sequenced and Targeted Strategy  <br>   <br>To deploy your strategy, it is essential to build a marketing calendar that differentiates actions according to segments and aligns them with your objectives (see the sheet "Formulating Objectives and Strategic Goals"). This will also help prioritize actions in case of overload.  </p>  <p> Marketing Planning </p>  <p>   <br>This example is based on segmenting the relationship to the institution according to the different stages of the conversion funnel (see the sheet "What is a 'conversion funnel' in the cultural context?"), but you can also choose to work with other types of segmentation (see the sheet "Studying audience behaviors to adapt your messaging") depending on the nature of your campaigns or your calendar. The key is to identify, each time, the most effective combination of: <br>  <br>  <br>the conversion objective to be achieved <br>  <br>  <br>the target audience <br>  <br>  <br>the timing <br>  <br>  <br>the message and its form <br>  <br>  <br>the communication medium <br>  <br>  <br>This differentiation also applies to the content of the offers themselves-which should depend on the individual's relationship with the institution-and concerns all communication channels, including the more traditional ones like season brochures or posters. For each channel, it is essential to put yourself in the audience's shoes: do they understand the codes to receive this communication? Is the medium appropriate to their relationship with culture? These are key questions to consider in order to target effectively while respecting the diversity of cultural practices. Keep in mind: <br>  <br>  <br>Precisely identify your audience segments based on data analysis. <br>  <br>  <br>Define specific actions adapted to each group according to their level of engagement. <br>  <br>  <br>Monitor results and adjust campaigns by analyzing booking and repeat purchase behaviors.  <br> </p>  <p> To go further  <br>   <br> [EN]  Let’s talk Loyalty Toolkit , Thrive Agency, 2022  <br>  <br>[EN]  A digital marketing toolkit , by Ticketsolve, 2023  <br>  <br>[EN]  The AMA MicroDigital Guide to developing personas of your ideal customer , Roisin Kirby, Refresh Marketing, 2021  <br>  <br>[EN]  Introducing Culture Segments , Morris Hargreaves McIntyre, CultureHive, 2021  <br>  <br>[EN]  Audiences I 15 stories about audience development , CKI and Rasmussen Nordic, March 2024  <br>  <br>[EN]  Top five tips for communicating with families online , Jocelyn Murdoch, Kids in Museums, 2021  <br>  <br>[EN]  Data-driven marketing strategies to engage tomorrow’s audience , Spektrix & Indigo Ltd, 2024  <br> [EN]</p>  <p>  Barriers to Engagement : what would make people attend? , The Audience Agency, February 2023  <br>  <br>[EN/NL]  Inventory of youth data in the cultural sector , CJP danois en partenariat avec The Taskforce Publieksdata, 2023 <br> </p>

These are key questions to consider in order to target effectively while respecting the diversity of cultural practices.</p><p>Keep in mind: </p><ul> <li> Precisely identify your audience segments based on data analysis. </li> <li> Define specific actions adapted to each group according to their level of engagement. </li> <li> Monitor results and adjust campaigns by analyzing booking and repeat purchase behaviors.</li> </ul><ul> </ul>
