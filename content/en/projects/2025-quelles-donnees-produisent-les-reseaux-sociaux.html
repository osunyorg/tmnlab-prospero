    2.08. What data is generated by social media?
  summary: >-
    <p>The presence of cultural equipment on social networks allows it to collect data that will be useful in its efforts to retain the public or to expand its communities, provided that it can be used. What are the data that can be collected there, and how can they be used for its digital marketing strategy?  </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Despite the debates surrounding them, social media platforms remain central tools in the communication and marketing strategies of theatres and cultural institutions. Indeed, they offer opportunities for renewed forms of audience engagement¹ and targeted digital marketing actions. Beyond sharing information, promoting events, and engaging in dialogue with their communities, these platforms also provide a valuable source of data that must be leveraged. By relying on this data, it is possible to better understand the audience, adapt communication, optimize the conversion funnel, and ultimately build loyalty among existing communities-or even reach new audiences. For a social media presence to yield real benefits, it must be accompanied by an effective strategy and regular monitoring. Beyond the myths surrounding social media, what data is truly actionable, and how can it be used effectively? <br>1  [FR] Marie Ballarini, " La création des contenus culturels sur les médias sociaux : entre médiation et communication ", Université Paris Dauphine - PSL; Laboratoire d'excellence Industries Culturelles et Création Artistique, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, 2023.</p>  <p> Understanding audience behavior on social media  <br>  </p>  <p>There are significant differences in how people use social media, with notable generational variations. For example, those under 29 are largely absent from Facebook, while people over 50 tend to avoid Instagram.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> Comparison of social media usage by users </p>  <p>Données recueillies lors d'une enquête menée d'octobre 2023 à septembre 2024 - </p>  <p>Source :  Statista.com</p>  <p>   <br>It is important to keep in mind that social media platforms themselves evolve in their ability to generate engagement. According to the social marketing platform Emplifi¹, organic engagement (i.e., unpaid) increased by 9% on Instagram in 2023, while the level of interaction continued to decline on Facebook (-17% in one year). It is therefore essential to stay regularly informed about these changes in order to understand whether your results on social media are due to your practices or to the platform itself. Many agencies monitor social media trends and provide analysis, such as We Are Social and its valuable and comprehensive "Digital Report." The social media management platform Swello also offers the high-quality #fridaynews every Friday to keep up with platform updates, particularly regarding new features. The data produced by social media offers an opportunity to better understand your relationship with the audience and to improve your marketing actions. However, this requires careful management to avoid getting lost in the mass of information. A structured approach, based on the analysis of posts, interactions, and demographic characteristics, is key to the success of your presence on these platforms.   <br>1  (EN) " The social media benchmarks to guide your 2025 strategy ", Emplify, février 2025</p>  <p> Rather limited data on audiences  <br>   <br>While social media platforms readily provide information regarding the impact of your posts, they are more reserved when it comes to details about the people who make up your audience. Only a few demographic data points (age, gender, geographic location) are available, which do not allow for an in-depth analysis of your communities. However, within the framework of advertising campaigns, you can target individuals based on their stated interests, which can be valuable if you want to expand your subscriber base or design an advertisement (see the factsheet  Understanding and investing in different forms of online advertising ). Additionally, social media platforms provide information about your audience's connection habits (connection times, type of device used, etc.). This helps determine the best time to post content and on which device (desktop or mobile). It is possible to study more data collected by social media through external solutions. These solutions "scrape" data from social media - that is, extract and store it in another IT environment for analysis or use. While not systematically illegal, this practice raises questions in relation to the European regulatory framework for the use of personal data (see our factsheet on the topic), particularly regarding the right to object, to be informed, and to give consent. Furthermore, this practice is highly disapproved of by platforms and may result in being banned from them (see the testimony of researcher Marie Ballarini in the TMNLab café listed in the resources below). More than profiling data, social media provides an opportunity to intersect topics (and therefore audiences), by bouncing off current subjects or trends - as demonstrated by community managers of major brands who know how to respond humorously to current events, or even mock their competitors...  </p>  <p> What types of data can be used on social media?  <br>  </p>  <p>Social platforms provide both quantitative and qualitative data, grouped into several categories:</p>  <p> Audience data: Who are your followers?  <br>Social networks allow you to understand the profile of people who interact with your content.
