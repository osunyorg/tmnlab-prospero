    2.11. What is an API and how is it useful to me?
  summary: >-
    <p>We often hear about it, without knowing exactly what it is... Now it's time to define what APIs are!</p>
  body: >-
    <p>The API, a bridge between your digital tools  <br>   <br>In the performing arts sector, audience interaction relies on a multitude of tools: ticketing systems, CRMs, newsletters, websites, mobile apps... Each system brings its own set of features and contributes to the richness-or, conversely, the complexity-of the overall customer experience. To function harmoniously, provide a seamless audience journey, and optimize team workflows, these systems must communicate with each other. This is where APIs, or  Application Programming Interfaces , come into play.  </p>  <p> What is an API?  <br>   <br>APIs are powerful tools  for optimizing audience data management. They enable communication between the various software systems that make up your digital work environment, saving time on data transfers while reducing the risk of duplication or errors. In other words, an API is a program that allows two distinct applications to communicate and exchange data. It consists of a set of rules and protocols that secure and automate these exchanges-eliminating the need for manual input from one tool to another, along with the errors and oversights that this might cause. An API can operate  in real time  or on a  scheduled basis  (often during off-peak hours, such as at night). Anyone working in a communication department knows there's no single digital tool versatile and powerful enough to fulfill all the needs of a marketing strategy. That's why APIs are so crucial: by using them-for example, to connect your  ticketing system with your CRM -you gain a  unified view of your audience . Simply put: if your CRM isn't connected to any other tool in your system, it's likely to go unused... because no one will input data into it manually.  </p>  <p> List of APIs </p>  <p>List of APIs offered by the software provider Weezevent to its clients  </p>  <p>   <br>Let's embody this principle with a concrete example:  <br> A spectator purchases a ticket on your online ticketing website.  <br> An API sends the purchase information (e.g. purchase date, product purchased, event date, buyer's first and last name, email address) to your CRM to update the client's record with a recent purchase.  <br> An API also sends the information to an emailing tool, which generates a transactional email confirming the purchase to the spectator.  <br> You can then send them a personalised email from your CRM before the event and a satisfaction survey after their visit.  <br> The performance of your system fully relies on the APIs linking the software components. APIs also allow different tools, through the connections they create, to automate certain marketing tasks (see sheet 29), for example: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br> Automatic follow-up of abandoned carts : if a spectator starts a reservation without completing their purchase, a CRM software can trigger a reminder email via an API. <br>  <br>  <br> Sending a practical information email to "first timers" : this email includes all essential information about your venue, from transport options to good local addresses! <br>  <br>  <br> Subscriber management : a spectator renewing their subscription can have their profile automatically updated in your CRM and receive instant confirmation, thanks to the API functionally connecting the ticketing system, the CRM, and the emailing tool for that specific purpose. </p>  <p> What precautions should be taken when implementing an API?  <br>   <br>The integration of an API requires technical support, whether through your ticketing provider, your in-house developer, or a specialized agency. It's essential to clearly define your needs and the connection points between your tools, and to test the system before deployment. Data exchanges via API involve handling personal data, which is why it's crucial to secure access (API authentication, data encryption) and comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by informing spectators of how their data is used and allowing them to manage their preferences. APIs are configured to process a specific type of data transfer: if a software provider claims to offer an API compatible with another solution, it's important to examine its scope to ensure it aligns with your intended uses. Finally, an API is fragile: it acts as a bridge between two software systems and must be maintained. If one of the systems changes its data structure, the API may stop working. For this reason, it's better to rely on APIs developed and maintained by the software providers themselves, unless you have internal resources available to handle ongoing maintenance.  </p>  <p> To go further  <br>   <br> [FR]  L'interopérabilité billetterie : enjeu économique et politique pour le spectacle vivant ? , BIS de Nantes, janv. 2024 <br>  <br> [FR]  Le panorama de l'interopérabilité billetterie en France – rapport d’étude intermédiaire , Arenametrix et My Open Tickets, janv. 2023   <br>  <br> [EN]  How to… exploit the opportunities of open data and APIs , James Mc Veigh, CultureHive, 2019   <br>  <br> [FR]  API : les recommandations de la CNIL sur le partage de données , CNIL, nov 2023   <br> </p>
