    <p>  <br>In the cultural sector, the concept of a "conversion funnel" refers to the series of steps an individual goes through before becoming a regular, engaged audience member of a cultural venue. The goal of a conversion funnel is to guide a user from the discovery phase of a cultural institution all the way to loyalty and sustained engagement. <br>What are these funnels made of? How does this principle help optimize strategies for audience acquisition and retention?  </p>  <p> The conversion funnel in the cultural sector: definition and stages  <br>   <br>A conversion funnel (also called acquisition funnel, conversion funnel, or marketing funnel) is a schematic representation of a user's journey. It visualizes the different stages an individual passes through before completing a desired action, such as purchasing a ticket or subscribing to a newsletter. The goal of each stage is to bring your target audience closer to the next step, and ultimately to regular attendance at the cultural venue. These stages can be divided into four main sequences:  </p>  <p> Conversion Funnel: Definition, Stages, and Tips for Optimization </p>  <p>  WiziShop</p>  <p> 1 - Awareness Development  <br>The first question to ask: does the audience I want to attract... know I exist? This is not about whether they are interested in the programming or like the venue, but rather about questioning the reputation of the institution or cultural project. Reputation also means knowing where the venue is located in its city. It is one of the pillars of cultural offer discoverability. <br>The goal here is to raise awareness of the cultural institution and attract the attention of target audiences. This stage aims to increase the visibility of a theatre or performance hall among those who do not yet know it. The means used may include: <br>  <br>  <br>Targeted digital advertising aimed at non-audiences and/or traditional advertising (posters, social media, partnerships) [see the dedicated sheet on online advertising - sheet 27 know and invest] <br>  <br>  <br>Participation in local events or partnerships with other institutions <br>  <br>  <br>Signage, exterior displays <br>  <br>  <br>Street marketing operations <br>  <br>  <br>An influencer strategy <br>  <br>  <br>Presence in local or cultural media. <br>  <br>  <br>For this part, it is important to rely on a diagnosis, identify weaknesses in terms of reputation to target and prioritize actions. A study may be necessary at first, relying on a specialized firm or a university partner. This can also be useful later, to evaluate the image among different audiences. <br>These qualitative data are key to a marketing strategy.  </p>  <p> 2 - Brand Image  <br>  Does the target audience know the institution? But what image do they have of it? Positive or negative? Accurate or very far from what it really is? How aligned are the project and the institution's actions with the image perceived by the public? <br>Because once the audience knows the institution, you need to make them want to engage with what it offers, to understand what it conveys, how to access and participate. This is the stage where the user begins to engage more deeply with the cultural brand: <br>  <br>  <br>Visiting the website to explore the programming <br>  <br>  <br>Subscribing/following on social media to stay informed [see 13: What data do social networks produce?] <br>  <br>  <br>Participating in free events or contests <br>  <br>  <br>And other levers already mentioned but targeted differently. <br>  <br>  <br>By understanding the weaknesses regarding your image (misunderstanding of the programming, prices perceived as too high, feeling of not belonging, belief that everything is always sold out, etc.), you can act more appropriately in service of your audiences (changing tone or updating descriptions, communicating about your ticket prices or promoting a premium experience, working on the venue's hospitality, targeted communication about last-minute tickets, etc.).  </p>  <p> 3 - Action  <br>At this stage, the spectator decides to take action: subscribing to a newsletter, registering for an activity, or purchasing a ticket for a show. To facilitate this conversion, it is possible to: <br>  <br>  <br>Offer special deals or limited-time promotions, especially those encouraging group attendance <br>  <br>  <br>Simplify the purchasing process, particularly online. The quality of the buying experience is crucial, as any obstacle in the journey can discourage your potential audience (for example: too many steps or in an unsuitable order, requesting too much information, an outdated interface, compatibility issues with a browser or mobile device, etc.) <br>  <br>  <br>Use clear "call-to-action" prompts in communication materials (purchase buttons, booking invitations)  <br> </p>  <p> 4 - Loyalty  <br>Once the spectator is acquired, the goal is to foster loyalty. A loyal spectator is not only a repeat buyer but also a potential ambassador for the institution! <br>Loyalty strategies may include: <br>  <br>  <br>A loyalty program with benefits for subscribers. <br>  <br>  <br>Personalized communications via email or social media. <br>  <br>  <br>Satisfaction surveys to improve the experience and maintain close connections. <br>  <br>  <br>The conversion funnel is a strategic tool to develop the audience of a cultural venue, both online and onsite. By mastering the key stages of the spectator journey and using available data, a cultural institution can refine its communication, optimize its marketing, and increase spectator loyalty. Whether you are a novice or an expert, integrating this concept into your strategies will help you build stronger and more lasting relationships with your audience while enhancing the cultural experience.  </p>  <p> Inbound Marketing in the Cultural Sector  <br>   <br>  The concept of inbound marketing fits perfectly within the logic of the conversion funnel as it is one of its tools. It is a strategy aimed at attracting spectators by providing them with relevant and quality content, rather than reaching them through intrusive means. Inbound marketing can take several forms:  <br>  <br> Blogs or articles  on the website presenting behind-the-scenes of shows, artist interviews, or analyses of upcoming works.  <br>  <br>  <br>Newsletters  offering exclusive information or previews of upcoming programs. [see sheet 28 define and implement your emailing policy]. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Social media  to engage in conversation with the public, offering quizzes, surveys, and interactive content.  <br> </p>  <p> How to Establish a Conversion Funnel for Your Organization? </p>  <p>  UpNet</p>  <p>   <br>Inbound marketing is based on a progressive approach that allows the institution to build a trusting relationship with the audience by providing relevant content throughout their journey. A true mapping of your customers' buying process, the "Buyer's Journey" (or "customer journey") is an important step in deploying an inbound marketing strategy. Indeed, this marketing tool - presented here by the marketing strategy consulting platform Invox - helps define these stages of the buying process and understand the customer's needs, motivations, and obstacles in their purchase journey. Inbound marketing is also one of the tools that help improve the organic search ranking of your website and social media pages [see sheet 31 implementing an SEO strategy]. For a conversion strategy to be effective, it is essential that it be based on audience segmentation established according to their characteristics and behaviors [see sheet 26 defining audiences]. Using data on spectator behavior (such as types of shows already seen or visits to the site), a performance venue can personalize its communications and adapt its marketing actions to each profile.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience.</p>  <p>Melissa Ragsdale  <br>Content Manager - Spektrix</p>  <p> To go further  <br>   <br> [FR]  Un bel exemple d’inbound marketing : interview de "La Minute Culture" , Audrey Mari, mars 2020  <br> [FR] T unnel de conversion : définition, étapes, conseils pour l’optimiser et exemples , Julie Sansonetti, Wizishop, fév 2022   <br>  <br> [EN]  Bringing Content Marketing Strategy into Performance Arts Marketing , Melissa Ragsdale, Spextrix, août 2023   <br>  <br> [EN]  Unlocking Success: How Performing Arts Organizations Can Harness the Power of Digital Marketing , S.
