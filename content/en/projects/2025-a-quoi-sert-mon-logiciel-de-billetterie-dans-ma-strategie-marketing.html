    2.04. How does my ticketing software support my marketing strategy?
  summary: >-
    <p>Your ticketing software is used daily to ensure the reservation of your shows and other cultural proposals. But it is also essential in the implementation of your marketing strategy... </p>
  body: >-
      <p>The ticketing system is the essential tool connecting a venue offering performances with the audience attending them. It plays a strategic role in the digital toolkit of cultural institutions. In fact, after the website, it is often the most visible and frequently used platform, due to the importance of its operational and communication functions. While it must, of course, offer a high-quality experience to users booking tickets, it is also crucial for communication and audience engagement teams, as it collects personal data about audiences as well as insights into their purchasing behaviours. This makes it a critical component in developing an effective marketing strategy based on reliable data. However, confusion often arises between the functions of a ticketing system and those of a customer relationship management tool (CRM). This section clarifies the distinction between the two.</p>  <p> </p>  <p> The ticketing system and the CRM: two distinct yet complementary tools supporting your marketing strategy  <br>   <br>The effective functioning of your ticketing system largely determines the quality of your actions within your CRM. It is through the data collected during bookings that you can analyse, understand, and respond to your audiences' behaviours. By gaining insight into audience preferences and enabling personalised targeting, this data becomes key to building loyalty among new audiences, attracting new spectators, and optimising venue attendance. <br>Many actions rely on a cultural venue's ticketing system.

It is quite common to confuse the uses of ticketing software with those of a CRM tool. However, this confusion between the principles and functionalities of these two systems can undermine the design and implementation of marketing strategies and prevent teams from getting the most out of either tool. Indeed, ticketing software and CRM systems share some similarities: both collect and store users' personal data - such as identity and contact details - and allow for the management of relationships between records (e.g. parent/child accounts, company/individual records). They also allow for the qualification of contacts through categories defined by the team (e.g. association, school, artist, partner, ambassador...). To work effectively together, these tools must be  interoperable , with synchronised databases. That said, the  marketing data management functionalities  of ticketing systems often end there. The following actions - often mistakenly expected from a ticketing system - should in fact be handled by your CRM tool: Developing quality interactions with audiences beyond the act of purchasing  Ticketing systems are not designed to track the full history of interactions with each customer. It is the CRM's role to track sent emails (including delivery, opens, clicks), phone calls, customer feedback or complaints. The CRM also allows audience relations teams to log audience preferences - such as preferred communication channels or a detailed history of previous interactions. Analysing customer behaviour and generating insights  Audiences interact with a cultural organisation in many ways: booking a ticket, browsing the website, subscribing or unsubscribing from a newsletter, entering a contest, using a promo code, visiting the organisation's social media... Only a CRM (or GRC) can aggregate all these touchpoints to generate meaningful insights into customer journeys and loyalty dynamics. Segmenting your audience database  Cross-referencing different types of data enables you to create audience profiles based on usage behaviours (how they access information, their responsiveness to communications, last-minute vs. early buyers, attending solo or with family...), demographic characteristics, or thematic interests drawn from the shows they book.  <br>This information fuels your marketing strategy - for example, by shaping targeted offers for specific audience segments. Managing, automating, and evaluating relationship marketing campaigns  While a ticketing system can gather audience consent for receiving promotional messages, it is the  CRM  that executes these campaigns and tracks audience behaviour (email opens, purchases triggered by a message, etc.). The CRM - often linked to an emailing or SMS tool - centralises and automates relationship marketing campaigns (e.g. pre- or post-visit emails, messages triggered by a customer action or inactivity).  <br>It also enables you to collect and analyse campaign results, assess their effectiveness, and make adjustments.   </p>  <p> The Importance of Interoperability  <br>   <br>Technical interoperability (the ability to understand one another)  refers to the capacity of different systems (e.g., ticketing software and CRM) to work together. It involves, in particular, the design of programmatic interfaces that allow for data exchange. In the digital sector, technical interoperability is often achieved through the implementation of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are software interfaces that allow one software or service to "connect" to another software or service in order to exchange data and functionalities.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>It is essential to further develop the notion of interoperability. For instance, if the opt-in status is collected via the ticketing system and transmitted to the CRM, the opt-out status must also be sent back from the CRM to the ticketing system. This is still very rarely the case, even though it is crucial both for the quality of marketing actions and for GDPR compliance. <br>It is also important to identify which data must be synchronized throughout the lifecycle of a purchase: from acquisition to exchanges, cancellations, and access control data. This prevents, for example, sending a thank-you message to a spectator who never actually attended the performance. <br>Progress has been made, but APIs are still not sufficiently accessible-especially when it comes to write access.</p>  <p>Erick Tallon <br>Rodrigue SA</p>  <p> To go further  <br>   <br> (FR)  Comprendre les comportements d’achat en ligne pour améliorer le parcours du spectateur , Anne Le Gall, TMNlab, 2018  <br> (FR)  La billetterie, levier de transformation numérique des théâtres ? , Captation audio des rencontres TMNlab  #15, 2019  <br>  (FR)  La billetterie : commercialiser et promouvoir une offre culturelle  Corinne Lefebvre, CNM éditions, 2024 <br>  <br> (FR)  Panorama de l'interopérabilité billetterie en France , Ticketr, 2023  <br> (FR)  Rapport de mission sur l’interopérabilité , présidé par Fayrouze Masmi-Dazi, 2024 </p>
