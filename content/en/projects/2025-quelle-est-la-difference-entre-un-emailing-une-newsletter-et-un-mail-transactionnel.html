      <p>Email communications have become commonplace in marketing practices in general, and in the cultural sector in particular. They represent an essential means of addressing audiences, engaging them, and building loyalty. There are three types of emails: marketing emails, newsletters, and transactional emails. To use them effectively and in a complementary way, it is important to understand the specific characteristics of each communication channel. Indeed, each serves distinct purposes, contains different types of information, and is sent at varying frequencies.</p>  <p> The newsletter, an editorial format to build loyalty and strengthen brand awareness  <br>   <br>The newsletter is a general information medium designed to  build loyalty among a community  of readers and to create or maintain a special connection with them. It allows for direct communication with a group of people, either existing audience members or individuals who have expressed interest in the venue's updates by subscribing. Sent regularly (weekly, biweekly, or monthly), it offers greater editorial freedom than other communication channels. Its purpose is not to immediately trigger purchases or bookings, but rather to nurture a long-term relationship with its readership. That is why the newsletter must provide high-quality content to its community, which may include, for example, exclusive content (i.e., not shared through the venue's other channels) such as behind-the-scenes insights into the programming, anecdotes, artist interviews, as well as practical information like upcoming performances. Despite having lost momentum a few years ago, the newsletter remains a highly relevant and important communication channel for cultural institutions. In fact, it is making a comeback as a preferred marketing tool across the broader communications landscape.  </p>  <p> The rise of specialized newsletters  <br>Since 2024, there has been a surge in highly specialized newsletters offering in-depth content on a wide range of topics-culture, society, technology, and more. Produced by content creators, media outlets, or brands, these communications attract a highly engaged readership and are in some cases monetized. In the case of media outlets, they are sometimes restricted to subscribers and form part of the content package accessible through a subscription. For such a content offering to be relevant to cultural institutions, it must align with the organization's editorial line, be carefully planned over the long term, and offer genuine added value. When these newsletters are thoughtfully developed and editorially rich, they can foster strong audience engagement.  </p>  <p> Emailing or marketing email, a promotional format to trigger purchases  <br>   <br>Emailing, or marketing email, is targeted communication sent to a specific segment of your database with the aim of prompting an action (purchase or reservation). It is used to promote an event or an offer, or to encourage a concrete action (subscription opening, season programming announcement, etc.) <br> Its purpose is  promotional  and should be acknowledged as such. Its target audience must be precisely defined according to its content to achieve the best conversion rate and avoid exhausting a segment of the audience unlikely to be receptive to the message. A launch offer with a reduced price, for instance, is unlikely to interest the last-minute buyers segment of your audience. (see sheet "Defining audiences to tailor your message")  </p>  <p>   <br>Summary of the characteristics of different email types</p>  <p> The transactional email, a technical format to build trust, ensure service, and maintain the relationship  <br>   <br>Transactional emails (or "trigger marketing") are automated emails sent individually to their recipient to confirm a transaction or follow up after an action (newsletter subscription, purchase confirmation, account creation, ticket placed in the basket without payment, reminder before an upcoming paid show, etc.).  Brief and effective in their content, these transactional emails are very important for online purchase actions: when well thought out, branded with the venue's identity, and providing the right information at the different stages of the spectator's journey, they are a powerful tool for reassurance and loyalty. Cultural organisations should not underestimate their importance , as the quality of the booking experience depends on their successful delivery to spectators, particularly for purchase confirmations and ticket delivery. Moreover, they are a valuable tool for maintaining the relationship and asserting the venue's identity (reminder 3 days before a show, first-time visit information, etc.). Transactional emails and marketing emails are fundamentally different:  <br>  <br>  <br> Marketing emails  are sent in bulk to a group of recipients selected according to the promotional message to be delivered and its purpose. <br>  <br>  <br> Transactional emails , on the other hand, are sent individually and automatically as soon as a person performs a specific action predetermined in the venue's email strategy. <br>  <br>  <br> Transactional emails are therefore not subject to the GDPR governing the use of personal data , unlike marketing emails, which must be based either on the recipient's explicit consent or on the legitimate interest provided for in the regulation (see GDPR factsheet). Beyond the practical information they provide , transactional emails can also promote new shows or automatically include promotional content. By mastering these different communication formats and using them in synergy , you will enhance the image and reputation of your venue while enriching the spectator's experience.  </p>  <p> To go further  <br>   <br> (EN)  The State of Email Marketing podcast episode , The Digital Marketing Podcast, Jul. 2024   <br>  <br> (EN)  Why is Email Newsletter Cool All Over Again, Sorab Ghaswalla , Medium, June, 2023   <br>  <br> (FR)  22 exemples de newsletters à succès qui vont vous inspirer , Wizishop, novembre 2024   <br> (FR)  Newsletter : le guide pour l'optimiser, la diffuser et la monétiser , Médiarama, décembre 2023   <br>  <br> (FR)  Des médias aux marques, la newsletter contre-attaque ! , Story Jungle, février 2024   <br> (FR)  La newsletter, stratégie d'avenir pour les médias et les influenceurs ? , Ali Ahmadi, Slate, mars 2024   <br> </p>
