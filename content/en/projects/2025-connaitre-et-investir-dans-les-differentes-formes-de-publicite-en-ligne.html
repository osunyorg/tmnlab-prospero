    3.06. Understanding and Investing in Different Forms of Online Advertising
  summary: >-
    <p>Find out here what forms of online advertising exist today, and how to mobilize them to serve your institution. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>To attract new audiences, retain them, and optimize ticket sales, online advertising is a strategically important lever for cultural organizations. In a context of increasing competition for attention and the diminishing impact of organic search (SEO) or organic reach on social networks  (see our dedicated sheet on these issues &gt; link to sheet 2 What societal challenges surround data?) , online advertising investment is a necessary element in a marketing budget. Several forms of online advertising are available to communication and marketing teams, each with its own advantages and particularities.  </p>  <p> Display: direct purchase or programmatic?  <br>   <br>The term "display" refers to various formats of graphic advertising. The purchase of display space can be done on specialized websites, through an advertising agency, or by negotiating directly with the concerned sites. The performance of this approach depends on a good prior understanding of your audiences  (see our dedicated guide: Link to sheet 25 Understanding audience behaviors and adapting your messaging: the importance of segmentation)  and thus of the audience segments that your venue currently reaches or has yet to reach. This understanding stems from the analysis of your data. The content of the advertisements must also align with the targeted audience and objective. For example, does a campaign aim to acquire spectators, thus immediate ticket sales, or to develop the notoriety of your venue?  </p>  <p> Classic display: secure purchasing on targeted media  <br>The purchase of digital ad space operates similarly to buying print space: it involves acquiring a space for a defined duration from a media outlet or through an advertising agency. Ad space purchasing can also be part of a media partnership that sometimes includes editorial content. <br>However, unlike print, buying digital ad space generally corresponds to: <br>  <br>  <br>a format (see below) and a placement on the site <br>  <br>  <br>a number of impressions for the ad, often rotating with other advertisers <br>  <br>  <br>a capping, meaning the limit on how many times an ad is shown to the same user. A capping of 2 to 3 impressions per person is recommended to avoid fatigue, while unlimited display can be perceived as intrusive. <br>  <br>  <br>Advantage: you know exactly what you pay for and for which impressions, with no prerequisites for implementation.  <br>Disadvantage: your budget is concentrated without the possibility to adjust based on results.   </p>  <p> Programmatic display: real-time adjustment  <br>  New intermediaries and platforms now exist to speed up the match between advertising space supply and demand, such as ad exchanges. These automated platforms act as real-time marketplaces managing the supply and demand of online advertising spaces, allowing campaign optimization and quick adjustment of criteria based on results. This also requires trusted partners to support you in these processes. Specialized agencies have positioned themselves with cultural actors in recent years. <br> Specifically, when choosing to advertise via programmatic investment: <br>  <br>  <br>You do not choose a single media but multiple ones, based on a target audience profile. <br>  <br>  <br>You do not select a single format but adapt one visual across multiple formats. <br>  <br>  <br>You set a maximum budget. <br>  <br>  <br>You implement tracking tools with your service provider. <br>  <br>  <br>The agency places your ad across various spaces and evaluates campaign performance in real time based on pre-set indicators - e.g., click-through rate for awareness campaigns, revenue generated for acquisition campaigns - to adjust placement and optimize your budget. <br>  <br>  <br>Different types of programmatic buys include: <br>  <br>  <br>RTB (Real Time Bidding): Automated auctions for advertising spaces. <br>  <br>  <br>PMP (Private Marketplace): Private auctions for premium inventory. <br>  <br>  <br>Guaranteed programmatic: Purchase of advertising space at a fixed price, but via an automated platform. <br>  <br>  <br>Advantage: your campaign adapts based on performance relative to target and goals. <br>Disadvantage: display costs can sometimes soar, and you must rely on a strong, truly expert, and trustworthy programmatic provider to manage your budget. They provide daily monitoring and transparent feedback. Note that your website and sales platform must be properly configured for tracking.  </p>  <p> Advertising retargeting to optimize conversion  <br>   <br>A cornerstone of online advertising, retargeting is a crucial step in the conversion funnels discussed in this guide  (link to sheet 16 "What are the different 'conversion funnels' in the context of cultural marketing?") . It involves targeting individuals who have already shown interest in your activity. Retargeting works on a simple principle: when a spectator visits a show's page without making a purchase, a specific ad is subsequently displayed to them on other sites they browse, encouraging them to return and complete their purchase. This method is particularly effective because it targets people already interested in the cultural offer, thereby increasing conversion rates and optimizing return on investment.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>I had run retargeting campaigns before, but they were quite costly and I struggled to find a suitable provider. Then, at the Monfort Théâtre, we looked for a new agency for a show by the company 26000 Couverts. It was quite surprising! It was a series of circumstances-the show was intriguing, the teaser was impactful, it was the holiday season... But by the end of the run, there were audiences we had never seen before. It was measurable, and very satisfying.</p>  <p>Eric Leite,  <br>Directeur de la communication, de la billetterie et du mécénat, Chaillot - Théâtre national de la Danse</p>  <p> Necessary Conditions for Implementing a Retargeting Campaign </p>  <p> 1. Audience data collection and segmentation <br>  <br> Have a website with visitor tracking (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, Google Tag Manager). <br>  <br>  <br>Identify visitor segments to target:  <br> - Visitors who viewed a show page without purchasing. - Cart abandoners. <br> - Past spectators who have not returned for some time. <br>  <br>  <br>Structure audience lists according to objectives (conversion, loyalty, etc.). <br>  <br>  <br> 2. Implementation of tracking tools <br>  <br> </p>  <p>  <br>Install a tracking Pixel (Meta Pixel for Facebook/Instagram, Google Ads Remarketing Tag). <br>  <br>  <br>Configure Google Tag Manager to collect key interactions (clicks, page views, cart abandonment). <br>  <br>  <br>Comply with GDPR rules: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>  <br> - Add a cookie consent banner. <br> - Allow users to accept or refuse tracking. <br>  <br> 3. Definition of campaign objectives <br>  <br>  <br>Conversion → Encourage purchase completion (e.g., "You liked X, book before it's too late!"). <br>  <br>  <br>Loyalty → Bring back occasional spectators with a specific offer. <br>  <br>  <br>Engagement → Offer complementary content (e.g., teaser video, reviews). <br>  <br> 4. Creation of adapted and personalized ads <br>  <br>  <br>Tailor messages according to targeted segments (e.g., "Your ticket is still waiting for you!"). <br>  <br>  <br>Test various formats: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br> - Display banners (Google Display Network). <br> - Dynamic ads (personalized carousels on Facebook/Instagram). <br> - Retargeting emails (Mailchimp, Sendinblue). <br>  <br>  <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>  <br> </p>  <p>  <br> 5. Budget and bidding strategy <br>  <br> </p>  <p>  <br>Define a budget adapted to the campaign duration and objectives. <br>  <br>  <br>Choose a bidding model: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>  <br> - CPC (cost per click) if the goal is to drive site visits. <br> - CPA (cost per acquisition) if the goal is to maximize purchases. <br>  <br>  <br> 6. Monitoring and performance optimization <br>  <br> </p>  <p> </p>  <p>  <br>Set up a tracking dashboard or entrust it to a provider. <br>  <br>  <br>Measure key indicators: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>  <br> - Click-through rate (CTR). <br> - Conversion rate (visitors who completed the purchase). <br> - Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). <br> </p>  <p>  <br>Adjust the campaign based on results (e.g., change visuals, test another message, refine the audience).  <br>Bonus: automate some follow-ups <br>  <br>  <br>Set up automatic emailing campaigns for cart abandoners. <br>  <br>  <br>Test dynamic scenarios (e.g., display a different show if the first one did not convert). </p>  <p> Social media advertising: reaching an engaged audience  <br>   <br>Alongside display advertising approaches, social media platforms represent an advertising world of their own. The advertising targeting capabilities are potentially powerful, as these platforms rely on their rich knowledge of users' tastes, opinions, life situations, behaviors, and habits. Each social network encompasses different communities and has its own codes, habits, and navigation logic. It is essential to know them well - beyond mere assumptions or personal use - to effectively define your strategy.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Visual from the article "Social Networks: The Generational Divide Widens," Valentine Fourreau, Statista, December 2024  </p>  <p>   <br>  The forms of advertising on social media are varied and flexible. You can sponsor posts, stories, videos, or display ads in carousel format. In this context, it's essential to adapt your campaign not only to the platform's codes but also to the targeted audience within it. However, it is important to note that the algorithms determining the visibility of your ads are constantly updated. The pricing policies for these ads are also regularly revised. <br>Each platform has its own advertising formats (updated January 2024): ✅ Facebook & Instagram Ads <br>  <br>  <br>Single Image <br>  <br>  <br>Carousel (multiple sliding images) <br>  <br>  <br>Video <br>  <br>  <br>Collection (shop integration) <br>  <br>  <br>Learn more with Facebook Business or this practical guide (EN) <br>  <br>  <br>✅ LinkedIn Ads <br>  <br>  <br>Sponsored Content (ads integrated into the news feed) <br>  <br>  <br>Sponsored InMail (ads sent directly as messages) <br>  <br>  <br>Dynamic Ads (personalized based on user profiles) <br>  <br>  <br>Learn more with LinkedIn Marketing Solutions <br>  <br>  <br>✅ TikTok Ads <br>  <br>  <br>In-Feed Ads (inserted between videos in the feed) <br>  <br>  <br>TopView (full-screen ad on app launch) <br>  <br>  <br>Branded Hashtag Challenge (interactive campaigns where users participate) <br>  <br>  <br>Learn more with TikTok for Business <br>  <br>  <br>✅ Also: <br>  <br>  <br>Snapchat for Business <br>  <br>  <br>In-app advertising: target a community of users of a specific mobile app (resource: "Conversion Goal: Practical Guide to In-App Advertising," Criteo, May 2020 - FR) <br>  <br>  <br>Finally, among the social media options, there is the possibility to leverage influencer marketing and content creation to reach new targets and communities. These increasingly common practices in cultural institutions allow you to: <br>  <br>  <br>Work within a UGC (user generated content) logic, delegating the voice to a third party for audiences where institutions are not prescribers; <br>  <br>  <br>Delegate the animation of your own pages to experts to improve content quality and conversation.  <br> </p>  <p> Search Ads and Keyword Buying  <br>   <br>  In the world of online advertising, search engine ranking is key. Indeed, statistics on search behavior are revealing: <br>  <br>  <br>Only 9% of Google users scroll to the bottom of the first results page. <br>  <br>  <br>50% of users click on a result within 9 seconds of their search. <br>  <br>  <br>65% of internet users click on an "organic" result (the classic blue link) during their search session. <br>  <br>  <br>Only 0.44% of users go to the second page of Google search results. <br>  <br>  <br>The vast majority (59%) of internet users view only one page of results during their search session. <br>  <br>  <br>It is therefore important for a cultural venue to work on both its natural, or "organic," SEO and its paid search around relevant topics and keywords (see the sheet &gt; "How to implement an SEO strategy between marketing, discoverability, and mediation"). Keywords to appear at the top of Google search results for specific queries - for example: "concert tickets Zagreb," "children's show Bologna," "Hamlet tonight," etc. - are purchased through the Google Ads platform (formerly called Adwords).   <br>1  Ces statistiques sont issues de l'article d'analyse de Brian Dean  "How People Use Google Search (New User Behavior Study)" , BacklinkO, 13  <br>février 2025 [EN]</p>  <p>   <br>It operates on an auction model. When a user performs a search that includes these keywords, a paid ad appears above the organic results, thereby increasing the visibility of the event and encouraging bookings. The main advantage of Google Ads is that it allows you to reach a qualified audience-that is, users actively searching for a show or cultural event. How to determine which keywords to buy? <br>  <br>  <br>Identify your target audience and put yourself in their shoes to imagine the terms they might use related to your programming. <br>  <br>  <br>Use keyword research tools such as Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and Google Suggest to expand your list and obtain data on the search volume related to your activity.  <br> </p>  <p> Choosing Your Keywords on Google Ads  <br>Elias Kadri's videos are recommended for beginners in keyword buying!   <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN8bbdb1-OI <br>CHOOSING the Right Keywords on Google Ads in 2025 (Free Methods)</p>  <p>   <br>Since Google Ads operates on a supply-and-demand basis, some popular keywords may cost you dearly due to intense competition. Therefore, it's in your best interest to strike a balance in your purchasing strategy between popular keywords and less competitive, more targeted terms. Similarly, it is recommended to use a mix of generic and more specific keywords to complement your targeting framework. For more information, we recommend reading the article "How to Choose the Right Keywords for a Google Ads Campaign?" by Moov Up (FR).  </p>  <p> Conclusion: Playing with Formats  <br>   <br>To maximize the impact of an online advertising campaign, it is recommended to adopt a combined approach using multiple channels depending on the defined objectives (see sheet 2.07: What is a "conversion funnel" in the cultural context?), for example: <br>  <br>  <br>Awareness &gt; Display, Programmatic, Video, Social Ads <br>  <br>  <br>Engagement &gt; Native Advertising, Interactive Social Ads <br>  <br>  <br>Conversion &gt; Search Ads, Retargeting, Shopping Ads <br>  <br>  <br>✅  Display: Classic banners  <br>  <br>  <br>Leaderboard (728x90 px): Large banner at the top of a webpage <br>  <br>  <br>Medium Rectangle (300x250 px): Often embedded within content <br>  <br>  <br>Skyscraper (160x600 px): Vertical banner on the side of a site <br>  <br>  <br>Billboard (970x250 px): Large banner at the top of a page <br>  <br>  <br>✅  Display: Rich Media or interactive and animated formats  <br>  <br>  <br>Expandable banner: Banner that expands on hover or click <br>  <br>  <br>Interstitial: Full-screen ad displayed during page transitions <br>  <br>  <br>Parallax scrolling ads: Background ads that scroll with content <br>  <br>  <br>In-banner video: Video embedded within a static banner <br>  <br>  <br>✅  Video formats  <br>  <br>  <br>Pre-roll: Video ads before a video (e.g., YouTube) <br>  <br>  <br>Mid-roll: Ads inserted in the middle of longer videos <br>  <br>  <br>Post-roll: Ads after a video <br>  <br>  <br>Out-stream video: Videos displayed outside a video player (e.g., within an article) <br>  <br>  <br>Bumper ads: Short (max 6 seconds), non-skippable video ads <br>  <br>  <br>✅  Audio & podcasts advertising  <br>  <br>  <br>Ads on Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music: Audio ads between tracks <br>  <br>  <br>Podcast ads: Sponsorship integrated into episodes <br>  <br>  <br>✅  Native Advertising (ads integrated into content)  <br>  <br>  <br>Sponsored articles: Content created in partnership with a brand <br>  <br>  <br>Content recommendations (e.g., Taboola, Outbrain): Suggested articles or videos at the bottom of a webpage <br>  <br>  <br>Ads integrated into newsfeeds (e.g., Google Discover or Twitter ads) <br>  <br>  <br>✅  In-App Advertising: capture mobile audiences  <br>As of January 2025, nearly 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free. In-app advertising is therefore an essential monetization method for app developers seeking revenue. These ads show very high retention rates among target audiences: 6.2% for news apps, 3.7% for Food & Drink and Health & Fitness, 2.1% for Education, 1.5% for Photography.   <br>1  Chiffres issus de l'article de Brock Munro :  "93 statistiques essentielles sur la publicité intégrée à l'application à connaître en 2025" , Publift, mars 2025. </p>  <p> To go further  <br> Developing Your Business with Online Advertising </p>  <p>"Developing your activity with online advertising" - Google Digital Workshops <br>Discover the existing advertising levers to promote your business online and acquire new clients.

This also requires trusted partners to support you in these processes. Specialized agencies have positioned themselves with cultural actors in recent years. </p><p>Specifically, when choosing to advertise via programmatic investment: </p><ul> <li> You do not choose a single media but multiple ones, based on a target audience profile. </li> <li> You do not select a single format but adapt one visual across multiple formats. </li> <li> You set a maximum budget. </li> <li> You implement tracking tools with your service provider. </li> <li> The agency places your ad across various spaces and evaluates campaign performance in real time based on pre-set indicators - e.g., click-through rate for awareness campaigns, revenue generated for acquisition campaigns - to adjust placement and optimize your budget. </li> </ul><p> Different types of programmatic buys include: </p><ul> <li> RTB (Real Time Bidding): Automated auctions for advertising spaces. </li> <li> PMP (Private Marketplace): Private auctions for premium inventory. </li> <li> Guaranteed programmatic: Purchase of advertising space at a fixed price, but via an automated platform. </li> </ul><p> Advantage: your campaign adapts based on performance relative to target and goals. Disadvantage: display costs can sometimes soar, and you must rely on a strong, truly expert, and trustworthy programmatic provider to manage your budget. They provide daily monitoring and transparent feedback. Note that your website and sales platform must be properly configured for tracking.  </p>

        <p>A cornerstone of online advertising, retargeting is a crucial step in the conversion funnels discussed in this guide <i>(link to sheet 16 "What are the different 'conversion funnels' in the context of cultural marketing?")</i>. It involves targeting individuals who have already shown interest in your activity. Retargeting works on a simple principle: when a spectator visits a show's page without making a purchase, a specific ad is subsequently displayed to them on other sites they browse, encouraging them to return and complete their purchase. This method is particularly effective because it targets people already interested in the cultural offer, thereby increasing conversion rates and optimizing return on investment.  </p>

            <p>  I had run retargeting campaigns before, but they were quite costly and I struggled to find a suitable provider. Then, at the Monfort Théâtre, we looked for a new agency for a show by the company 26000 Couverts. It was quite surprising! It was a series of circumstances-the show was intriguing, the teaser was impactful, it was the holiday season... But by the end of the run, there were audiences we had never seen before. It was measurable, and very satisfying.  </p>

        <p>Alongside display advertising approaches, social media platforms represent an advertising world of their own. The advertising targeting capabilities are potentially powerful, as these platforms rely on their rich knowledge of users' tastes, opinions, life situations, behaviors, and habits.</p><p>Each social network encompasses different communities and has its own codes, habits, and navigation logic. It is essential to know them well - beyond mere assumptions or personal use - to effectively define your strategy.  </p>

        <p>  The forms of advertising on social media are varied and flexible. You can sponsor posts, stories, videos, or display ads in carousel format. In this context, it's essential to adapt your campaign not only to the platform's codes but also to the targeted audience within it. However, it is important to note that the algorithms determining the visibility of your ads are constantly updated. The pricing policies for these ads are also regularly revised. Each platform has its own advertising formats (updated January 2024):</p><p>✅ Facebook & Instagram Ads </p><ul> <li> Single Image </li> <li> Carousel (multiple sliding images) </li> <li> Video </li> <li> Collection (shop integration) </li> <li> Learn more with Facebook Business or this practical guide (EN) </li> </ul><p> ✅ LinkedIn Ads </p><ul> <li> Sponsored Content (ads integrated into the news feed) </li> <li> Sponsored InMail (ads sent directly as messages) </li> <li> Dynamic Ads (personalized based on user profiles) </li> <li> Learn more with LinkedIn Marketing Solutions </li> </ul><p> ✅ TikTok Ads </p><ul> <li> In-Feed Ads (inserted between videos in the feed) </li> <li> TopView (full-screen ad on app launch) </li> <li> Branded Hashtag Challenge (interactive campaigns where users participate) </li> <li> Learn more with TikTok for Business </li> </ul><p> ✅ Also: </p><ul> <li> Snapchat for Business </li> <li> In-app advertising: target a community of users of a specific mobile app (resource: "Conversion Goal: Practical Guide to In-App Advertising," Criteo, May 2020 - FR) </li> </ul><p> Finally, among the social media options, there is the possibility to leverage influencer marketing and content creation to reach new targets and communities. These increasingly common practices in cultural institutions allow you to: </p><ul> <li> Work within a UGC (user generated content) logic, delegating the voice to a third party for audiences where institutions are not prescribers; </li> <li> Delegate the animation of your own pages to experts to improve content quality and conversation.</li> </ul><ul> </ul>

        <p>  In the world of online advertising, search engine ranking is key. Indeed, statistics on search behavior are revealing: </p><ul> <li> Only 9% of Google users scroll to the bottom of the first results page. </li> <li> 50% of users click on a result within 9 seconds of their search. </li> <li> 65% of internet users click on an "organic" result (the classic blue link) during their search session. </li> <li> Only 0.44% of users go to the second page of Google search results. </li> <li> The vast majority (59%) of internet users view only one page of results during their search session. </li> </ul><p> It is therefore important for a cultural venue to work on both its natural, or "organic," SEO and its paid search around relevant topics and keywords (see the sheet &gt; "How to implement an SEO strategy between marketing, discoverability, and mediation").</p><p>Keywords to appear at the top of Google search results for specific queries - for example: "concert tickets Zagreb," "children's show Bologna," "Hamlet tonight," etc. - are purchased through the Google Ads platform (formerly called Adwords).  </p>

        <p>It operates on an auction model. When a user performs a search that includes these keywords, a paid ad appears above the organic results, thereby increasing the visibility of the event and encouraging bookings. The main advantage of Google Ads is that it allows you to reach a qualified audience-that is, users actively searching for a show or cultural event.</p><p>How to determine which keywords to buy? </p><ul> <li> Identify your target audience and put yourself in their shoes to imagine the terms they might use related to your programming. </li> <li> Use keyword research tools such as Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and Google Suggest to expand your list and obtain data on the search volume related to your activity.</li> </ul><ul> </ul>

        <p>Since Google Ads operates on a supply-and-demand basis, some popular keywords may cost you dearly due to intense competition. Therefore, it's in your best interest to strike a balance in your purchasing strategy between popular keywords and less competitive, more targeted terms.</p><p>Similarly, it is recommended to use a mix of generic and more specific keywords to complement your targeting framework. For more information, we recommend reading the article "How to Choose the Right Keywords for a Google Ads Campaign?" by Moov Up (FR).  </p>

        <p>To maximize the impact of an online advertising campaign, it is recommended to adopt a combined approach using multiple channels depending on the defined objectives (see sheet 2.07: What is a "conversion funnel" in the cultural context?), for example: </p><ul> <li> Awareness &gt; Display, Programmatic, Video, Social Ads </li> <li> Engagement &gt; Native Advertising, Interactive Social Ads </li> <li> Conversion &gt; Search Ads, Retargeting, Shopping Ads </li> </ul><p> ✅ <strong>Display: Classic banners</strong> </p><ul> <li> Leaderboard (728x90 px): Large banner at the top of a webpage </li> <li> Medium Rectangle (300x250 px): Often embedded within content </li> <li> Skyscraper (160x600 px): Vertical banner on the side of a site </li> <li> Billboard (970x250 px): Large banner at the top of a page </li> </ul><p> ✅ <strong>Display: Rich Media or interactive and animated formats</strong> </p><ul> <li> Expandable banner: Banner that expands on hover or click </li> <li> Interstitial: Full-screen ad displayed during page transitions </li> <li> Parallax scrolling ads: Background ads that scroll with content </li> <li> In-banner video: Video embedded within a static banner </li> </ul><p> ✅ <strong>Video formats</strong> </p><ul> <li> Pre-roll: Video ads before a video (e.g., YouTube) </li> <li> Mid-roll: Ads inserted in the middle of longer videos </li> <li> Post-roll: Ads after a video </li> <li> Out-stream video: Videos displayed outside a video player (e.g., within an article) </li> <li> Bumper ads: Short (max 6 seconds), non-skippable video ads </li> </ul><p> ✅ <strong>Audio & podcasts advertising</strong> </p><ul> <li> Ads on Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music: Audio ads between tracks </li> <li> Podcast ads: Sponsorship integrated into episodes </li> </ul><p> ✅ <strong>Native Advertising (ads integrated into content)</strong> </p><ul> <li> Sponsored articles: Content created in partnership with a brand </li> <li> Content recommendations (e.g., Taboola, Outbrain): Suggested articles or videos at the bottom of a webpage </li> <li> Ads integrated into newsfeeds (e.g., Google Discover or Twitter ads) </li> </ul><p> ✅ <strong>In-App Advertising: capture mobile audiences</strong><br> As of January 2025, nearly 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free. In-app advertising is therefore an essential monetization method for app developers seeking revenue. These ads show very high retention rates among target audiences: 6.2% for news apps, 3.7% for Food & Drink and Health & Fitness, 2.1% for Education, 1.5% for Photography.  </p>
