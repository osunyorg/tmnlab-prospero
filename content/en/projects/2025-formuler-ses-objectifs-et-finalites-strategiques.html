    4.01. Formulating Strategic Objectives and Goals
  summary: >-
    <p>Here we focus on the right ways to define and leading marketing team strategies based on objectives of the structure.  </p>
  body: >-
      <p>To guide teams in data use efforts, it is essential to set clearly defined qualitative or quantitative objectives that are collectively shared. These goals must align with the institution's overall strategy while remaining operational and achievable. How do these objectives represent not a constraint but an essential tool for daily team work, and how should they be defined?</p>  <p> </p>  <p> Clear and shared objectives serve both as the horizon and the rudder  <br>   <br>Objectives enable members of the institution to navigate their missions with clearer perspective and to better evaluate their daily actions. This visibility on the expected results empowers them to improve continuously. <br>They also help foster teamwork, where everyone knows their role and direction to achieve the collective strategy. <br>An effective strategic objective is: <br>  <br>  <br> Explicitly defined:  clear, understandable, and achievable, providing precise guidance. <br>  <br>  <br> Collectively shared:  documented, displayed, discussed, and communicated to teams to ensure buy-in and engagement. <br>  <br>  <br>These objectives structure actions and guide daily decisions while offering a framework to measure results and improve practices. They must align with the institution's overall strategy, relying on the institution's project and roadmap from which data-related work will be derived.  <br> Examples of strategic objectives come in two types: ðŸ”¹  Quantitative objectives:  based on measurable and verifiable figures. For example:  <br>ðŸ‘‰ Increase attendance of 18-25 year-olds by 15% within two seasons.  <br>ðŸ‘‰ Reduce no-show rates by 20% through improved spectator reminder policies. ðŸ”¹  Qualitative objectives:  focus on more subjective improvements and experience-related challenges. For example:  <br>ðŸ‘‰ Enhance the relationship with spectators by developing mediation actions adapted to new audiences.  <br>ðŸ‘‰ Strengthen audience engagement through more immersive and interactive digital tools. <br> Ideally, combine both approaches:  a qualitative objective can be supported by quantitative indicators to measure its impact.Â Â </p>  <p> The importance of collective decision-making  <br>To be achievable, relevant, and realistic, objectives must be coherent with one another, which requires a collective process of prioritization within the institution. Careful formulation of objectives also helps avoid contradictory demands. For example, an objective might aim to diversify audiences toward social or youth sectors. Such a qualitative goal must align with any quantitative targets of the institution. In this example, if a significant increase in revenue is targeted simultaneously, doubling the number of young audience members-who usually pay lower ticket prices-may be incompatible. Objectives must therefore be clearly specified to remain realistic and achievable; otherwise, conflicting goals may set teams up for failure. Financial objectives are also a necessary part of this process. Cultural institutions include revenue lines in their budgets, which must be co-developed with teams responsible for marketing performances and audience development. Without explicit, precise financial targets-whether per show, by audience segment, or by season-objectives cannot be effectively applied or mobilized daily. Quantitative and qualitative objectives enable teams to make objective daily decisions. For instance, should a challenging-to-sell performance be prioritized for its visibility benefits, or another whose high production cost demands maximum attendance? It is not always about prioritizing shows guaranteed to succeed; sometimes political choices supporting creation must be made consciously. The key is to avoid pursuing all objectives simultaneously without clear strategy. Finally, strategic objectives must not remain theoretical. To become true drivers of action: <br> </p>  <p>  <br>  <br>They must be visible: displayed on dashboards accessible to teams. <br>  <br>  <br>They must be regularly monitored: monthly meetings can be dedicated to their evaluation. <br>  <br>  <br>They must be adaptable: objectives can be adjusted as circumstances evolve. </p>  <p> Two methodologies: SMART and OKR  <br>   <br>Well-defined objectives enable you to: <br>  <br>  <br>Provide clear direction: ensuring all actions serve a common purpose. <br>  <br>  <br>Facilitate decision-making: helping teams prioritize options and measure results. <br>  <br>  <br>Encourage cross-team collaboration: creating a shared language around data. <br>  <br>  <br>Foster continuous improvement: by setting tracking indicators to evaluate effectiveness and adjust strategies.  <br> Setting strategic objectives is essential for the success of marketing activities-and beyond. Properly defined, objectives are not constraints but structuring tools that guide decisions and strengthen team cohesion. This step is key to ensuring the effectiveness and coherence of actions within cultural institutions. By combining qualitative and quantitative goals and organizing collective trade-offs, you can create positive momentum and engage your teams toward shared success.Â Â </p>  <p> The SMART method: a clear framework to set precise objectives  <br>Â  A good objective must be SMART: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>S pecific: it answers a precise question. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>M easurable: its impact can be evaluated with indicators. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>A chievable: it is realistic given the available resources. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>R ealistic: it fits within the institution's overall strategy. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>T ime-bound: it has a clear deadline. <br>  <br>  <br>Example of a poorly formulated objective:  "Attract more young audiences."  <br>SMART version:  "Increase the share of 18-25 year-olds in the contemporary dance audience by 15% by the end of next season, through a social media communication campaign." SMART  is ideal for precise and measurable objectives, often short-term.Â Â </p>  <p> The OKR method: a results- and ambition-driven approach  <br>OKR (Objectives & Key Results) refers to a goal-setting methodology designed to help your team set and track measurable objectives. Developed by John Doerr, this method pairs the objectives you want to achieve with key results used to measure your progress. This way, objectives are connected to your team's daily activities. <br>OKRs aim to set ambitious goals while measuring success through key results. An OKR consists of two parts: <br>  <br>  <br>Objective (O): It should be inspiring, ambitious, and motivating. <br>  <br>  <br>Key Results (KR): They define how to measure the achievement of the objective. <br>  <br>  <br>Two examples of OKRs for a cultural institution: <br> Objective:  Strengthen retention of regular attendees.  <br> Key Results:  <br>  <br>  <br>Increase the repurchase rate by 20% among spectators who attended at least two shows this season. <br>  <br>  <br>Achieve a 40% open rate on loyalty email campaigns. <br>  <br>  <br>Launch a flexible subscription program with at least 500 subscribers by the end of the season. <br>  <br>  <br> Objective:  Improve data analysis and usage to better understand audiences.  <br> Key Results:  <br>  <br>  <br>Centralize ticketing, CRM, and social media data into a single dashboard. <br>  <br>  <br>Organize three training workshops for teams on audience data analysis. <br>  <br>  <br>Produce an initial audience segmentation report with strategic recommendations. <br>  <br>  <br> Why use OKR?  <br>  <br>  <br>Encourage ambition: OKRs push teams to aim higher while remaining realistic. <br>  <br>  <br>Align teams: All departments work towards measurable results. <br>  <br>  <br>Continuously measure progress: Key results are regularly assessed. <br>  <br>  <br>Compared to SMART, OKR is better suited for ambitious strategies with a medium to long-term vision.Â Â  <br>1   Execution is Everything - Do what matters with OKRs.</p>  <p> To go further  <br>   <br> [EN]  The OKR Method: Why and How to Adopt It? , Wemanity, february 2022  <br> [FR]  MÃ©thode OKR : Guide complet pour objectifs et rÃ©sultats clÃ©s en management , Supermood, dÃ©cembre 2022  <br>  <br>[FR]  Les objectifs SMART dans le contexte de la gestion de la performance au sein des organisations artistiques,  Vorecool, octobre 2024  <br>  <br>[FR]Â   Les indicateurs de performance dans les institutions culturelles publiques du spectacle vivant en France selon la Loi organique relative aux lois de finances (LOLF) , Ammar Kessab, Doctorant en Sciences de Gestion Ã  l'UniversitÃ© d'Angers, 2009 </p>
