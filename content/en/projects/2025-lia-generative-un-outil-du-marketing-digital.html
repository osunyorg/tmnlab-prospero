    <p>Here, it is assessed to what extent the opportunities offered by the development of generative artificial intelligence can be used for public development and retention strategies. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Disclaimer / Warnings:  <br> This sheet deals with Artificial Intelligence (AI), whose development is still rapidly evolving at the time of writing this note. The evolution of this technology may outpace the update of this page.  <br> Generative AI is a probabilistic tool that can make mistakes: its results and outputs must be carefully analyzed.  <br> If you use generative AI to analyze personal data, remember to anonymize it to comply with GDPR.  <br> The use of AI should be supported by internal training and governed by an AI usage charter.  <br> More information in this section: Understanding the issues and training for responsible AI use.   <br> </p>  <p>   <br>For several years now, so-called generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) technologies have been developing across all areas of private and professional life, spreading at an astounding pace. According to a 2024 study by Hostinger and FLASHS involving 1,000 business leaders and managers from small, medium, intermediate, and large French companies, more than 60% of respondents reported that their organization used AI. Even more indicative of the rapid adoption of these technologies, only 17% of those surveyed said they had never used generative artificial intelligence tools professionally at the time of the survey. Among the cited application areas, data analysis, customer service, and personalized customer journey actions occupy the top three spots. Cultural organizations also use generative AI tools to optimize their activities. Many of the solutions they already use have integrated AI into their processes, whether in office automation, ticketing, or graphic design. Generative AI, as an assistant for content creation or data analysis, promises to transform the digital marketing of cultural institutions, as it is already doing in other economic sectors, by accelerating the creation of textual or visual content and facilitating the understanding of customer data. However, its use also entails several limitations, biases, and risks that must be acknowledged to ensure a conscious and context-aware application.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Graph extracted from the study "French companies in the era of artificial intelligence and no-code," Hostinger & FLASHS, 2024</p>  <p> AI for content creation: towards adapted and effective communication  <br>   <br>Generative AI can produce texts, visuals, and videos tailored to an institution's identity by leveraging its previous data and publications to respect its style, editorial voice, and image. Specialized AI tools for image generation can also be used to design posters or banners. For example, a marketing team could prepare social media visuals while maintaining the organization's graphic identity. It's important to note that using AI tools for creation requires strong skills both in prompting and in evaluating the quality of the output. Teams may need to understand AI uses and set ethical guidelines to work effectively with specialized providers skilled in AI. AI can also act as a spelling and grammar assistant, offering reformulations to improve writing-something many word processors still struggle with. Here, AI serves as a writing partner, enabling iterative refinement. Again, the quality of training and complementary communication strategy skills will determine whether the content produced is good or poor.  </p>  <p>   <br>Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, many existing software solutions have developed AI-based features without replacing their original service: for example, Canva with its 'magic' writing and image generation features, or Grammarly, the English spelling and grammar correction tool, which now includes AI-powered rewriting and text suggestion capabilities. It is also worth noting that most Microsoft and Google products have integrated similar functionalities. These are often the first tools with which teams are trained to understand how AI works and to evolve their professional practices.  </p>  <p>   <br>  Some AI use cases: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Optimize SEO:  AI tools analyze trends and relevant keywords to maximize content visibility on search engines. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Automatically generate subtitles and descriptions:  Ideal for videos and multimedia content to improve accessibility and engagement. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Personalize messages for different audience segments:  Tailor tone and style according to the expectations of regular viewers, new audiences, or potential customers. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Facilitate translation and multicultural adaptation:  Allowing content distribution to international audiences without heavy manual work. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Automate monitoring and trend analysis:  Identify topics that interest the public to adjust communication in real time. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Analyze past publications  to suggest content consistent with an institution's editorial line. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Analyze successful campaigns to guide communication  and propose innovative formats. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Automatically generate tailored texts  based on a content base, editorial line, and audience targeting elements.  <br> </p>  <p> AI for data analysis: optimizing audience insights  <br>   <br>Generative AI is known for its writing and visual creation capabilities. But it is not just a creative tool; it can also simplify the management and analysis of audience data, especially for small marketing and ticketing teams that have not yet invested in data analysis (see the two dedicated sheets on this topic), helping them effectively exploit their ticketing databases and extract valuable insights. AI is not limited to technical assistance; it enables the extraction of strategic indications that facilitate decision-making and optimize marketing actions. We remind you again that: <br>  <br>  <br>Generative AI is a probabilistic tool that makes errors: its results and outputs must be carefully analyzed. <br>  <br>  <br>If you use generative AI to analyze personal data, be sure to anonymize it to comply with GDPR. <br>  <br>  <br>The use of AI must be supported by internal training and governed by an AI usage policy.  <br> </p>  <p>   <br>Here are some AI usage ideas: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Clean and analyze datasets:  remove duplicates, correct errors. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Predict audience behavior:  AI can analyze purchase histories and interactions to anticipate attendance trends and forecast show occupancy rates. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Suggest audience segmentation strategies:  AI can analyze your files to identify groups with similar behaviors and recommend targeted actions. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Optimize marketing campaigns and pricing:  by analyzing purchase behavior, AI can recommend price adjustments based on demand (yield management) or suggest the best times to launch promotions. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Automate reporting and data visualization:  AI tools can automatically generate clear, dynamic dashboards, making analysis accessible to all teams without technical expertise. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Detect audiences at risk of disengagement:  by identifying attendees whose visit frequency decreases, AI can help target personalized re-engagement and loyalty campaigns. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Recommend personalized shows:  based on past preferences, AI can suggest shows tailored to each spectator, enhancing experience and engagement. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Facilitate integration with existing tools:  even without advanced CRM or BI, AI-based solutions can adapt to standard ticketing files (Excel, CSV) to provide quickly actionable analyses and recommendations. <br>  <br>  <br>A key factor for using AI effectively in this context is the quality of your datasets.  </p>  <p> Explore other marketing applications with generative AI:  <br> Improving your website </p>  <p>Generative AI tools can analyze your website to identify how it is understood by algorithms. A good exercise? Ask NoteBookLLM to present your activity based on your website... Then, generative AI tools can help you choose suitable keywords, create content aligned with your editorial line and copywriting goals (action triggers), and meet web requirements in terms of structure (keywords, headings, length). When well configured and used as support - with you maintaining control over strategic choices, prompt personalization, and careful review - this can make your productions more effective.</p>  <p> Recommendation and Personalization of the Experience </p>  <p>Based on the practice of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technology that enhances generative AI model responses by feeding them knowledge from an institution's internal databases and cross-referencing with personalization data - AI can enable the production of cultural mediation content and personalized recommendations for audiences in real time. This can be done through chatbots or offline, such as writing documents or emails.</p>  <p> Optimization of your marketing strategy </p>  <p>Designed by Google teams for professionals aiming to leverage artificial intelligence to strengthen their marketing campaigns, this training will teach you how to use AI tools to gain efficiency and relevance. From market research to data analysis and defining a value proposition, AI can support you at every step of your strategy.</p>  <p>  <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-sL44hjw6s <br>Optimize your marketing strategy with AI</p>  <p> The Arts Marketing Association's Tool Selection  <br>Each month, the Arts Marketing Association invites Andrew Davis, a digital marketing expert since 2001 and creator of the podcast  In A(I) Nutshell , to share three tools to stay ahead in the world of marketing, creativity, and productivity through AI. These tools are designed to help cultural professionals work smarter, faster, and more efficiently.   Access Andrew Davis's AI resources for the Arts Marketing Association [EN].</p>  <p> Understanding the challenges and training to use AI responsibly  <br>   <br>The use of generative artificial intelligence raises several ethical, legal, qualitative, and environmental issues that are important to understand, know, and master in order to use these technologies consciously and responsibly. The use of AI in the cultural sector must be thoughtful and regulated to avoid abuses that could affect content authenticity, data protection, the environment, and employment. Avoid dependence and homogenization of content Studies on the impact of generative AI tend to show its detrimental effect on users' critical thinking abilities¹, which is why it is important to remain in control of the tool and use it in a reasoned and critical way regarding its outputs.  <br>  <br>Generative AI should be used as an assistant tool and not as a substitute for human creativity.  <br> It is a statistical technology, capable of inventing information, book titles, or scientific articles based on probabilities. Therefore, a degree of skepticism toward its outputs is necessary, and sources should be requested.  <br> Personalizing and reinterpreting AI-generated content is crucial to preserve a strong and distinctive editorial identity.  <br> Protect personal data and comply with GDPR  <br> Cultural institutions must choose solutions compliant with European regulations and avoid integrating sensitive data into uncertified tools.  <br> Inform the public about data usage and prioritize local solutions or AI trained on secure and transparent databases.  <br> Limit algorithmic biases and ensure diversity of representation  <br> Verify that the tools used do not reinforce stereotypes in marketing campaigns, programming, or audience analyses.  <br> Combine algorithmic analysis with critical human review to avoid errors and discriminatory biases.  <br> Limit environmental impact through responsible use  <br>  <br>Generative AI usage exacerbates a trend already underway that predicts a massive increase in the carbon footprint of our digital activities-potentially up to 60% by 2040 according to a joint study by ADEME and ARCEP².  <br> While generative AIs are energy-intensive during training, they do not all remain so during operation³.  <br> Favor less energy-consuming AI solutions and limit superfluous usage (avoid systematically generating content).  <br> Raise team awareness about the environmental impact of AI queries and encourage responsible digital practices.  <br> Anticipate work transformations and support teams  <br> Train professionals for a critical and informed use of AI so that it becomes a lever for innovation rather than a constraint.  <br> Encourage active monitoring of changes in professions impacted by AI, especially in administrative and creative sectors.  <br> Reflect on the risk of job replacement by AI (photographers, authors, graphic designers...), the impact on creative quality, and the institution's social responsibility in this area.  <br> Generative AI is a powerful lever for cultural organizations, facilitating content creation and data analysis. However, it is an opportunity to seize with discernment. Its use must fit within a global strategy and take into account the ethical, ecological, and human challenges outlined above. A tool remains a tool: it is up to humans to give it meaning. By training and adopting a critical approach, cultural professionals can harness these technologies while preserving the uniqueness of their institution. Training will be the best way to ensure a reasoned and situated use of these technologies-understanding core functions, recognizing and avoiding algorithmic biases, and identifying relevant use cases. This will allow relying on AI without giving it a blank check.   <br>1  " AI’s cognitive implications: the decline of our thinking skills?

        <p><b>Here are some AI usage ideas: </b></p><ul> <li> <b> Clean and analyze datasets: </b>remove duplicates, correct errors. </li> <li> <b> Predict audience behavior:</b> AI can analyze purchase histories and interactions to anticipate attendance trends and forecast show occupancy rates. </li> <li> <b> Suggest audience segmentation strategies:</b> AI can analyze your files to identify groups with similar behaviors and recommend targeted actions. </li> <li> <b> Optimize marketing campaigns and pricing:</b> by analyzing purchase behavior, AI can recommend price adjustments based on demand (yield management) or suggest the best times to launch promotions. </li> <li> <b> Automate reporting and data visualization:</b> AI tools can automatically generate clear, dynamic dashboards, making analysis accessible to all teams without technical expertise. </li> <li> <b> Detect audiences at risk of disengagement:</b> by identifying attendees whose visit frequency decreases, AI can help target personalized re-engagement and loyalty campaigns. </li> <li> <b> Recommend personalized shows:</b> based on past preferences, AI can suggest shows tailored to each spectator, enhancing experience and engagement. </li> <li> <b> Facilitate integration with existing tools:</b> even without advanced CRM or BI, AI-based solutions can adapt to standard ticketing files (Excel, CSV) to provide quickly actionable analyses and recommendations. </li> </ul><p> A key factor for using AI effectively in this context is the quality of your datasets.  </p>

        <p>  Generative AI tools can analyze your website to identify how it is understood by algorithms. A good exercise? Ask NoteBookLLM to present your activity based on your website... Then, generative AI tools can help you choose suitable keywords, create content aligned with your editorial line and copywriting goals (action triggers), and meet web requirements in terms of structure (keywords, headings, length). When well configured and used as support - with you maintaining control over strategic choices, prompt personalization, and careful review - this can make your productions more effective.  </p>

        <p>  Based on the practice of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technology that enhances generative AI model responses by feeding them knowledge from an institution's internal databases and cross-referencing with personalization data - AI can enable the production of cultural mediation content and personalized recommendations for audiences in real time. This can be done through chatbots or offline, such as writing documents or emails.  </p>

        <p>The use of generative artificial intelligence raises several ethical, legal, qualitative, and environmental issues that are important to understand, know, and master in order to use these technologies consciously and responsibly.</p><p>The use of AI in the cultural sector must be thoughtful and regulated to avoid abuses that could affect content authenticity, data protection, the environment, and employment.</p><p><strong>Avoid dependence and homogenization of content</strong></p><p>Studies on the impact of generative AI tend to show its detrimental effect on users' critical thinking abilities¹, which is why it is important to remain in control of the tool and use it in a reasoned and critical way regarding its outputs.</p><ul> <li> Generative AI should be used as an assistant tool and not as a substitute for human creativity.</li> <li>It is a statistical technology, capable of inventing information, book titles, or scientific articles based on probabilities. Therefore, a degree of skepticism toward its outputs is necessary, and sources should be requested.</li> <li>Personalizing and reinterpreting AI-generated content is crucial to preserve a strong and distinctive editorial identity.</li> </ul><p><strong>Protect personal data and comply with GDPR</strong></p><ul> <li>Cultural institutions must choose solutions compliant with European regulations and avoid integrating sensitive data into uncertified tools.</li> <li>Inform the public about data usage and prioritize local solutions or AI trained on secure and transparent databases.</li> </ul><p><strong>Limit algorithmic biases and ensure diversity of representation</strong></p><ul> <li>Verify that the tools used do not reinforce stereotypes in marketing campaigns, programming, or audience analyses.</li> <li>Combine algorithmic analysis with critical human review to avoid errors and discriminatory biases.</li> </ul><p><strong>Limit environmental impact through responsible use</strong></p><ul> <li> Generative AI usage exacerbates a trend already underway that predicts a massive increase in the carbon footprint of our digital activities-potentially up to 60% by 2040 according to a joint study by ADEME and ARCEP².</li> <li>While generative AIs are energy-intensive during training, they do not all remain so during operation³.</li> <li>Favor less energy-consuming AI solutions and limit superfluous usage (avoid systematically generating content).</li> <li>Raise team awareness about the environmental impact of AI queries and encourage responsible digital practices.</li> </ul><p><strong>Anticipate work transformations and support teams</strong></p><ul> <li>Train professionals for a critical and informed use of AI so that it becomes a lever for innovation rather than a constraint.</li> <li>Encourage active monitoring of changes in professions impacted by AI, especially in administrative and creative sectors.</li> <li>Reflect on the risk of job replacement by AI (photographers, authors, graphic designers...), the impact on creative quality, and the institution's social responsibility in this area.</li> </ul><p>Generative AI is a powerful lever for cultural organizations, facilitating content creation and data analysis. However, it is an opportunity to seize with discernment. Its use must fit within a global strategy and take into account the ethical, ecological, and human challenges outlined above. A tool remains a tool: it is up to humans to give it meaning. By training and adopting a critical approach, cultural professionals can harness these technologies while preserving the uniqueness of their institution. Training will be the best way to ensure a reasoned and situated use of these technologies-understanding core functions, recognizing and avoiding algorithmic biases, and identifying relevant use cases. This will allow relying on AI without giving it a blank check.  </p>
